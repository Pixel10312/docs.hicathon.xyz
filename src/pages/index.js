                <div>At the intersection of crypto, art, and technology, Hic Et Nunc (HEN), the first Tezos-based NFT marketplace, has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the metaverse as a bohemian and decentralised movement.

While yet in its nascent stage, 150 volunteers from 77 countries banded together to be a part of the first hackathon, or ‚Äúhicathon‚Äù, from May 22nd to 23rd in a purely community-led and volunteer-driven manner to support and accelerate the platform‚Äôs development further. Afterwards, 7 teams met again during September 2021 to transform their prototypes into functioning products ready to be implemented or to be used. 

The following is a comprehensive summary of the journey done by the Working Groups (WG) during the hicathon, from May to September 2021, and provides a succinct understanding of the core issues they tackled, their journey, and their accomplishments:

                </div>
            </div>
    );
